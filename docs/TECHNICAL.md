pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract R2PTokenContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
    mapping(address => bool) public authorizedDistributors;
    
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    uint256 public constant BURN_RATE = 100; // 1% burn on transactions
    
    event TokensDistributed(address recipient, uint256 amount, string milestone);
    event TokensBurned(uint256 amount);
    
    function distributeReward(address recipient, uint256 amount, string memory milestone) 
        external onlyAuthorized {
        require(balances[address(this)] >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance");
        
        uint256 burnAmount = amount / BURN_RATE;
        uint256 distributionAmount = amount - burnAmount;
        
        balances[recipient] += distributionAmount;
        totalSupply -= burnAmount;
        
        emit TokensDistributed(recipient, distributionAmount, milestone);
        emit TokensBurned(burnAmount);
    }
}
```

**AchievementVerificationContract:**
```solidity
contract AchievementVerificationContract {
    struct Achievement {
        address user;
        string milestoneId;
        uint256 rewardAmount;
        bool verified;
        uint256 timestamp;
        string evidenceHash;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Achievement) public achievements;
    mapping(address => bool) public verifiers;
    
    event AchievementSubmitted(bytes32 achievementId, address user, string milestoneId);
    event AchievementVerified(bytes32 achievementId, uint256 rewardAmount);
    
    function submitAchievement(string memory milestoneId, string memory evidenceHash) 
        external returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32 achievementId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, milestoneId, block.timestamp));
        
        achievements[achievementId] = Achievement({
            user: msg.sender,
            milestoneId: milestoneId,
            rewardAmount: 0,
            verified: false,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            evidenceHash: evidenceHash
        });
